# RE3-Autosplitter

To use this autosplitter, in LiveSplit enter the name of the game as one of the following:
* Biohazard 3
* Biohazard 3: Nemesis
* Biohazard 3 Nemesis
* Resident Evil 3: Nemesis
* Resident Evil 3 Nemesis
* RE3: Nemesis
* Resident Evil 3 1999
* Resident Evil 3 (1999)
* RE3
* RE3 1999
* RE3 (1999)

If using the REbirth version, your .exe must be named "BIOHAZARD(R) 3 PC.exe". All others should be named "bio3_PC.exe". If you are running the REbirth patch, please make sure that you have the version used on the leaderboard. The current patch will not work with the autosplitter and will give a nonsense time readout. (It is intentionally unsupported as it is not allowed on the leaderboard.)

## Door Splits

The autosplitter supports three main routes:
* any%
* Nemesis%
* any% Knife only

Route notes:
* The any% route follows the late crank route and is usable with the splits which end in "Fin". It does not split in the "Major RNG" sections of the run: from the train crash through exiting the chapel after grabbing the key and from entering the 4F of the hospital through entering the hospital save room on the way out. It does not split on reloading the basement alleyway nor the System Disk room.
* Nemesis% gets early crank. It does not split in the "Major RNG" sections of the run: from the train crash through exiting the chapel after grabbing the key and from entering the 4F of the hospital through entering the hospital save room on the way out. It does not split on reloading the basement alleyway nor the System Disk room.
* The any% Knife Only splits are largely the same as the any% splits, except they do split during all of the Clock Tower and does B3 first in the hospital.

## Door Split Alterations
* "Add splits for reloading rooms" adds in splits for reloading the basement alleyway and System disc rooms.
* "Include doors from major RNG sections" adds in splits for every door in the Early/Late powder segments and in the hospital.
* "Hospital B3 before 4F" alters the any% and Nemesis% splits to do the hospital basement first. This requires checking the Major RNG sections option as well.
* "Alters the route to get early crank" -- pretty self explanatory :) applies to any% and any% Knife Only routes.

## Other Door Split Sets

This section includes options to check to use other existing sets of door splits. At the moment there is only support for the any% splits which end in "Over Hiear", but it is possible I may add more if people ask.

Currently Supported Splits:
* any% "Over Hiear" splits

## Basic Door Splits

This option will split on EVERY door transition you make! The few exceptions are if you repeately go through the middle train door, the door between the dining room and piano room as Carlos, and the Dead Factory elevator and Treatment Control room (where the System Disc is), this has to do with the room ID not changing there, nothing I can do about it unfortunately.

## Key Item Splits

If you'd like to split on key items, this is the option for you! These are compatible with door splits as well if you'd like to split on both items and doors. This is fully customizable so you can pick and choose which items you'd like to split on. This group of splits contains the key items you'd pick up in a typical any% run.

## Additional Items to Split On

Here are additional items that you can split on. Could be useful for Nemesis%. Some of these you wouldn't pick up in a run, but hey, they're here if you want 'em!

## Fully Customizable Door Splits

Not happy with any of the above routes? In this section, you can completely customize which doors to split on, and you have 245 options! A few things to note about this section:
* The splits always happen in the order listed, you can skip splits, but you cannot go backwards in this list.
* The option is to split on exiting that room (except the ones that say "Room A to Room B", then it splits on that specific door transition).
* For the Hospital splits, pay careful attention to the B3/4F notes on them and the route you are taking.

If any names are confusing and you have suggestions for improvement, feel free to message me!

## Blank Splits Files

Visit the [RE3 SRC resource page](https://www.speedrun.com/re3/resources) to download template split files. This will be the upload by me (deserteagle417). It includes the usual "Fin" any% splits and versions of Nemesis% and any% Knife Only splits built like the "Fin" any% splits.
